// This file containes the plans and their features

/*
We have three cases: new, upgrade, renewal.
New: No alteration of the price is needed, only adjustment for promotions.
Renewal: No alteration of the price is needed, only potential adjustment for promotions. TODO
Upgrade:
1) We need to know what plan the user is on now.
2) Only display plans that are higher than the current plan.
3) We need to account for the remaining days of the current plan.
4) Calculate the prorated price for the remaining days.
5) We need to account for the period of the current plan.
6) We need to account for the period of the new plan.
7) We need to account for promotions. TODO

    If the user is on a special plan like NEW, MODERATOR, ADMIN,

    days are reset to 365, and no amount is subtracted from the upgrade price.

    For all other cases:

    If only 30 days or fewer have been used so far ((365 - $remainingDays) <= 30),
    then the full original price of the current plan level is subtracted from
    the upgrade price, and the remaining days are reset to 365.

    If only 30 days or fewer remain in the subscription, then nothing is subtracted
    from the upgrade price, and the remaining days are set to 0.

    In all other cases, the amount used so far is calculated based on a daily rate
    and subtracted from the upgrade price. The remaining days are unchanged.
