		<h2>NOSTR.BUILD</h2>
		<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<h4>Effective December 24, 2022</h4>
		<p>
			Using our app, api or website to do anything other than access the links to this "Terms" page or accessing any
			page of our website other than our home page and this "Terms" page constitutes your consent to these terms of use
			and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not consent, do not use our
			website. Your use of our website to do anything beyond simply accessing/viewing it (that is, uploading,
			downloading, commenting, etc.), constitutes not merely your consent, but also your electronic signature, meaning
			that you are contractually bound by these terms and by our Privacy Policy.
			Summary of Arbitration Provisions These Terms contain a binding arbitration provision and class action waiver
			terms. Unless you opt out or there is a suit in small claims court, you and we agree to submit disputes to a
			neutral arbitrator and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.
			Please see the arbitration section below for details. Our community rules These Terms of Use are our contract with
			you. We also have community rules, developed thanks to input from the nostr.build community, that serve as rules
			for using nostr.build publicly. Stuff not to do If someone else
			might own the copyright to it, don't upload it. Don't upload gore, "hate speech" (i.e. demeaning race, gender,
			age, religious or sexual orientation, etc.), or material that is threatening, harassing, defamatory, or that
			encourages violence or crime. Don't upload illegal content such as child
			porn or nonconsensual ("revenge") porn. Don't hotlink to adult content or to file-sharing, gambling, torrent,
			warez, or nostr.build rip-off sites. Don't impersonate someone else. Also, don't use nostr.build to host image
			libraries you link to from elsewhere, content for your website,
			advertising, avatars, or anything else that turns us into your content delivery network. If you do – and we will
			be the judge – or if you do anything illegal, in addition to any other legal rights we may have, we will ban you
			along with the site you're hotlinking from, delete all your
			images, report you to the authorities if necessary, and prevent you from viewing any images hosted on nostr.build.
			We mean it. Stuff to do, please Please have tons of fun! That's what nostr.build is all about. If something isn't
			fun -- if you see anything on our site that shouldn't be there
			because it violates our policies, is illegal (e.g. revenge porn or child porn), or for some other reason, please
			let us know by emailing us at admin@nostr.build pr @nostr.build on nostr.
		</p>
		<h4>About images you upload</h4>
		<p>
			You can upload images anonymously and share them online with only the people you choose to share them with. If you
			upload using nostr's free service, they may be featured in the gallery or View All section. If you share an image
			publicly with nostr, Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, etc.,
			then it may also end up in the View All or Gallery section.
		</p>
		<h4>Details</h4>
		<p>
			12/24/2022 Intellectual Property By uploading a file or other content or by making a comment, you represent and
			warrant to us that (1) doing so does not violate or infringe anyone else's rights; and (2) you created the file or
			other content you are uploading, or otherwise have sufficient
			intellectual property rights to upload the material consistent with these terms. With regard to any file or
			content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant nostr.build a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
			perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment
			rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow
			downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content. To the extent that you delete any such file or content
			from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to
			nostr.build pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect
			to any file or content nostr.build has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of
			course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used
			by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it. USE OF nostr.build CONTENT By
			downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from nostr.build, you agree that you do not
			claim any rights to it. The following conditions apply: You may use UGC for
			personal, non-commercial purposes. You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law,
			for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute ("nostr.build" or
			"courtesy of nostr.build") next to where it is displayed. You may not use
			UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes. Your use of UGC is at your own risk. nostr.build MAKES NO WARRANTIES
			OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, and you will indemnify and hold nostr.build harmless from any copyright infringement claims
			arising out of your use of the UGC. (See our general disclaimers
			below.) You may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.
			NOTICES OF CLAIMED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (OR OTHER TYPES OF INFRINGEMENT) If you see anything on our site that
			you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our
			Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following information: Identification of the
			copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed. IMPORTANT: please include your copyright registration
			number. If your work is not yet registered, please include a copy of the
			application to register the work that you filed with the Copyright Office. A copyright infringement claim based on
			a U.S. work can only be filed if the work has been registered (http://www.copyright.gov/eco/). Registration
			currently takes about seven months. Identification of the material on
			our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be removed, including the URL or other information to
			enable us to locate the material. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the
			manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner,
			or by your agent, or by law. A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of
			perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right
			that is allegedly being infringed. Your physical or electronic
			signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf. Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably
			email, but also address and phone. Because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid, nostr.build
			reserves the right to ignore DMCA notifications based on unregistered
			works. Email: nostr.build@gmail.com.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we receive a DMCA takedown demand for material you posted that we believe constitutes fair use, we will attempt
			to notify you if we have your contact info; otherwise we are under no obligation to notify you regarding the
			removal. We reserve the right to refuse to remove any material that
			in our view constitutes fair use. If we identify you as a "repeat infringer," we will block or remove your images
			and terminate any accounts you have with us. (If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate
			counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat
			infringer.) Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes
			or violates any of our policies. Use of Trademark Any uses of our name, trademarks, and logos must follow our
			Trademark Use Policy. Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver
			You and we agree to resolve any and all disputes with binding individual arbitration before a single arbitrator
			appointed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and not to sue
			in court in front of a judge or jury. The neutral arbitrator will
			decide the dispute, and the arbitrator's decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the
			FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, requests for public
			injunctive relief, and any other proceeding or request for relief where
			someone acts in a representative capacity are not permitted. The term "dispute" shall be understood to be as broad
			as it can be. It includes any disputes, controversies, claims, etc., arising from or relating to your use of
			nostr.build, your relationship with nostr.build, and these Terms,
			under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation. Arbitration Procedure To
			initiate an arbitration, you must submit a Demand for Arbitration to the email address of nostr.build@gmail.com.
			The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration
			Rules (unless you are not an individual or the value of the dispute is more than $75,000 in which case it will
			adopt the Commercial Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org. These Terms govern to the extent
			they conflict with any applicable AAA rules. In a dispute involving
			$25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to
			hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a
			business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award
			the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
			only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim but not relief that would affect non-parties. The
			arbitrator shall have the power to rule on all issues except that a
			court has exclusive authority (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and
			enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private
			attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public
			injunctive relief; and (iii) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this provision.
			Arbitration Fees and Payments. For individuals, we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and
			arbitrator's fees and expenses if the dispute involves less than
			$75,000. Otherwise, including for individual disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA rules will govern payment
			of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. Small Claims Court Exception. Instead of
			proceeding with arbitration, either you or we may sue the other party
			in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court's
			requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small claims court must be in
			your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of
			business). Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this section unenforceable
			as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to
			arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or
			remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on
			liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of this
			section is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect
			(with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins). Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of
			Remedies, Indemnity Although of course we strive to make nostr.build as dependable as possible, nostr.build's
			services are provided on an AS IS – WITH ALL FAULTS basis. Your use of
			our service is entirely at your own risk. We do not guarantee the availability of our service at any given time,
			or the reliability of our service when it is running. We do not guarantee the integrity of, or the continued
			availability of, files on our servers. Whether we make backups, and if
			so, whether restoration of those backups will be available to you, is at our discretion. nostr.build DISCLAIMS ALL
			WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS AND MERCHANTABILITY.
			NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE STATED IN THESE TERMS, AND
			IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER nostr.build TAKES OR DOES NOT TAKE MEASURES TO REMOVE INAPPROPRIATE OR HARMFUL CONTENT
			FROM ITS SITE, nostr.build HAS NO DUTY TO MONITOR ANY CONTENT ON ITS SITE. nostr.build DOES NOT ASSUME
			RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, APPROPRIATENESS, OR HARMLESSNESS OF ANY
			CONTENT APPEARING ON nostr.build THAT IS NOT PRODUCED BY nostr.build, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO USER CONTENT,
			ADVERTISING CONTENT, OR OTHERWISE. Your sole remedy for the loss of any services and/or of any images or other
			data you may have stored on nostr.build's service is to discontinue
			your use of our service. nostr.build WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
			CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, nostr.build'S SERVICES, EVEN
			IF nostr.build HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR REASONABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE
			POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF nostr.build'S SERVICES MAY BE BROUGHT
			MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER IT OCCURS. YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD nostr.build AND ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL HARMLESS FROM
			ALL LOSS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING
			REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, YOUR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY
			THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, AND ANY HARM CAUSED TO ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF YOUR UPLOADING OF FILES, COMMENTS, OR
			ANYTHING ELSE TO OUR SERVERS. Miscellaneous "nostr.build" or "we"
			refers to nostr.build, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its successors and assigns. "You" refers to any person
			who has consented to these terms or has become contractually bound to them, whether such person is identified or
			not at the time. These terms are governed by California law,
			excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between you and nostr.build, jurisdiction and
			venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa
			Clara County, California otherwise. If any part of these terms
			is invalid, the remaining provisions will be unaffected. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement among
			the parties relating to this subject matter, and they will continue to govern any issues that arise out of your
			use of nostr.build's services even after you discontinue using
			them. We may revise these terms from time to time without notice. Whenever we do so, we will so indicate by
			changing the version date at the top. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted. nostr.build is not meant
			for use by children under age 13; if your child is younger than 13
			please allow him or her to use it only under your supervision. Parental control protections (such as computer
			hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to
			material that is harmful to minors. See e.g.
			www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-internet-filter-software.
