      We support many different media types including .jpg, .png, .gif, .mov, .mp4, .mp3, and .wav. We compress JPEGs, PNGs and GIFs,

      nostr.build is now directly integrated into most Nostr apps making it just one click to add your media, like other popular and social media platforms.

    <h3>Roadmap</h3>

    <p><span style="color:white">Free Account:</span> This would be just enough to get someone started with nostr.buildâ€™s media management features and slightly larger media size uploads.
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Lifetime Account:</span> This would be something like all features, all experimental features, 1TB of storage for life, and two free t-Shirts.
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Traditional and AI Media Editors:</span>  Combining a powerful, standard media editor Pintura, with modern AI image editing features from stability.ai 
      would allow users to quickly and easily modify their media using multiple tools.
      </br><a class="ref_link" href="https://pqina.nl/pintura/?ref=pqina" target="_blank">https://pqina.nl/pintura/?ref=pqina </a>
      </br><a class="ref_link" href="https://stability.ai/stable-image" target="_blank">https://stability.ai/stable-image </a>
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Video Transcoding and Player:</span> nostr.build has never modified video meaning all different formats and sizes are uploaded, 
      none of them optimized for the platform they are being viewed on, and all of them in many different formats. By properly transcoding 
      the media it will be viewable, optimized and faster on all platforms the video is being watched on, Android, iOS, desktops, laptops, etc.
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Expandable Storage:</span> The ability to purchsase additional chunks of storage and add it to your existing account.
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Blossom:</span> Blobs Stores Simplly On Metterveses is a nostr spec that uses nostr public/private keys to securely store user content on a selected Blossom server.
    </p></br>

    <p><span style="color:white">Primal Support:</span> Integrated support for the nostr Primal app. No more copy/paste, just select nostr.build as your media provider and start uploading direct from Primal.
